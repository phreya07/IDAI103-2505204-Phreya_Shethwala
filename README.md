ArtRestorer AI is an AI-powered web application that provides expert guidance for art restoration and cultural heritage preservation. It helps users analyze artwork damage, understand historical and cultural contexts, and receive ethical conservation recommendations for paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, murals, textiles, and ceramics.

🎨 ArtRestorer AI

# 📌 Project Overview

ArtRestorer AI is a web application that helps users understand and plan art restoration in a responsible way. It provides guidance on restoration methods, background information, and ethical conservation practices for different types of artworks such as paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, murals, textiles, and ceramics.
The app combines knowledge of art history with AI technology to act as a helpful digital assistant for students, professionals, and art enthusiasts. Rather than carrying out physical restoration, it offers clear and culturally respectful suggestions based on user descriptions to support informed decision-making.

# 🎯 Purpose

The purpose of ArtRestorer AI is to support the preservation and understanding of cultural and historical artworks. It aims to make restoration knowledge easier to access and helps users learn about artwork damage, materials, artistic styles, and ethical restoration approaches.
The application also connects modern AI technology with traditional cultural heritage practices. It is designed as an educational and advisory tool and is not meant to replace certified professional conservators.

# 🏆 Project Goals

The main goals of ArtRestorer AI are to:

Provide restoration guidance based on the artwork’s time period, style, and cultural background

Help users identify possible damage and condition issues

Encourage ethical conservation practices such as minimal intervention and reversibility

Support both traditional and digital restoration processes

Offer a simple and visually engaging platform for learning and research

# 💡 User Motivation

Users may choose to use ArtRestorer AI because of:

An interest in preserving history and cultural heritage

Limited access to professional art conservation advice

Curiosity about artistic techniques, materials, and historical styles

Academic needs for students, teachers, and researchers

Museum documentation, exhibition preparation, and digital art projects

The app helps users feel more confident and informed before making any restoration-related decisions.

# ⚠️ Limitations of Existing Heritage & Restoration Applications

Many existing art restoration tools face several challenges, including:

Being too technical and difficult for non-professionals to use

Limited cultural and historical awareness

Generic AI responses that lack art-specific detail

Poor design and outdated user interfaces

Is suitable for students, professionals, and art enthusiasts

# 🛠️ How ArtRestorer AI Solves the Problem

ArtRestorer AI addresses restoration challenges by:

Using carefully designed prompts to guide AI responses

Including historical context, material analysis, and ethical reasoning

Presenting suggestions in a clear and organised manner

Giving users control over creativity levels based on their needs

Encouraging informed thinking rather than direct restoration action

# ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

ArtRestorer AI follows important conservation ethics, such as:

Suggesting minimal changes to original artworks

Being transparent about the limitations of AI-generated guidance

# 🌐 Deployment
The application is built and deployed using Streamlit and can be accessed here:

# 🔑 API Integration Note
I have used the OpenAI API key because the Gemini API key could not be used due to age restrictions and access limitations. As a result, the OpenAI API was used to ensure that the application works smoothly and reliably.
