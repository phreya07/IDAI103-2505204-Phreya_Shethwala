It helps users analyze artwork damage, understand historical and cultural contexts, and receive ethical conservation recommendations for paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, murals, textiles, and ceramics.

🎨 ArtRestorer AI

# 📌 Project Overview
ArtRestorer AI is an AI-powered web application designed to assist in art restoration, conservation, and cultural heritage preservation. The application provides expert-level restoration guidance, historical context, and ethical conservation recommendations for a wide range of artworks, including paintings, sculptures, manuscripts, murals, textiles, and ceramics.
By combining art history, conservation principles, and generative artificial intelligence, ArtRestorer AI functions as a smart digital assistant for professionals, students, and art enthusiasts. The system generates structured, culturally sensitive restoration insights based on user-provided descriptions rather than direct physical intervention.

# 🎯 Purpose
The purpose of ArtRestorer AI is to support the preservation and understanding of cultural and historical artworks by making expert restoration knowledge more accessible. The application helps users analyze damage, materials, artistic styles, and ethical restoration approaches while bridging the gap between modern AI technology and traditional cultural heritage practices.
The app is designed strictly as an educational and advisory tool and is not intended to replace certified professional conservators.

# 🏆 Project Goals

The key goals of ArtRestorer AI are to:

Provide accurate restoration guidance based on art period, style, and cultural context

Assist users in identifying artwork damage and condition issues

Promote ethical conservation principles such as minimal intervention and reversibility

Support both traditional and digital restoration workflows

Offer an intuitive, visually engaging platform for art research and learning

# 💡 User Motivation

Users are motivated to use ArtRestorer AI due to:

A strong interest in preserving history and cultural heritage

Limited access to professional conservation advice

Curiosity about artistic techniques, materials, and historical styles

Academic and educational requirements (students, teachers, researchers)

Museum documentation, exhibition planning, and digital visualization projects

ArtRestorer AI empowers users by providing clarity, confidence, and structured guidance before making any restoration-related decisions.

# ⚠️ Limitations of Existing Heritage & Restoration Applications

Many existing art restoration tools and applications face the following challenges:

Overly technical systems designed only for professionals

Lack of cultural and historical sensitivity

Generic AI outputs with no art-specific understanding

Poor user experience and outdated interfaces

Absence of ethical conservation standards

Limited support for diverse global art traditions

# ✅ How ArtRestorer AI Is Different

ArtRestorer AI addresses these limitations by:

Combining generative AI with art history and conservation ethics

Supporting multiple art forms and global cultural traditions

Offering adjustable creativity levels (from conservative to creative)

Generating structured, professional restoration reports

Maintaining a visually rich, modern, and user-friendly interface

Being accessible to students, professionals, and enthusiasts alike

# 🛠️ How ArtRestorer AI Solves the Problem

ArtRestorer AI solves restoration challenges by:

Using structured prompt engineering to guide AI outputs

Integrating historical context, material analysis, and ethical reasoning

Providing clear and well-organized restoration suggestions

Allowing users to control the creativity level based on use case

Encouraging informed decision-making rather than direct restoration action

# ⚖️ Ethical Considerations

ArtRestorer AI follows internationally recognized conservation ethics, including:

Minimal intervention in restoration recommendations

Reversibility of suggested restoration methods

Respect for cultural, religious, and historical significance

Transparency in AI-generated outputs and limitations

# 🌐 Deployment
The application has been deployed using Streamlit and is accessible at:

Streamlit App: https://5ygqq9gvw22ws9gsbxhuii.streamlit.app/

# 🔑 API Integration Note
I have used the OpenAI API key because the Gemini API key could not be used due to age restrictions and access limitations. As a result, the API integration was changed to OpenAI, which provided reliable access and allowed the project to function smoothly without interruptions.
